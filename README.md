Project Summary – React Movie Favorites App

As part of my learning journey in React development, I followed a YouTube tutorial titled "Build a Movie App with React & TMDB API" by Lama Dev. The project involved building a fully functional movie application using React that allows users to search for movies via The Movie Database (TMDB) API, view details, and manage a personalized list of favorite films using localStorage for persistence.

Key Features Implemented
Movie Search: Integrated TMDB API to fetch and display movie data dynamically.

Favorites System: Enabled users to add/remove movies from a favorites list, which is saved in the browser’s localStorage.

React Context API: Used createContext, useContext, and a provider to manage global state for favorites across components.

Responsive UI: Built a responsive grid layout to display movies and styled it using CSS and animations.

State Management with Hooks: Leveraged useState and useEffect for local state handling and data persistence.

What I Learned
React Fundamentals: Improved my understanding of component structure, props, and JSX.

State & Side Effects: Gained hands-on experience using useState and useEffect for managing dynamic UI behavior and syncing with localStorage.

Context API: Learned how to use context to avoid prop drilling and maintain global state across the app.

Debugging: Practiced debugging React errors and understanding stack traces, such as missing imports and undefined variables.

Responsive Design: Applied CSS Grid and Flexbox for adaptive layouts, and animations for improved user experience.

This project not only helped reinforce my React skills but also gave me experience working with third-party APIs, modular architecture, and real-world app workflows.
