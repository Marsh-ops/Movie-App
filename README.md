Project Overview

The Movie App is a React-based web application designed to browse and manage a list of movies using data from The Movie Database (TMDb) API. Users can view popular movies, search for any movie by name, and maintain a personalized list of favorites. The app features smooth user interactions such as adding and removing favorites, and it persists user selections across sessions.



This project helped me learn how to:

Work with asynchronous API calls to fetch real-time data

Manage React state and props for dynamic UI updates

Implement user event handling for actions like adding/removing favorites

Deploy a React application on GitHub Pages to share publicly

Structure and organize a React project for scalability and maintainability
